# Modus Migration Logging Tool

## Purpose
Log a comprehensive summary of the entire migration process for each analyzed file, including analysis, migration, verification, and any issues or recommendations. This log should reflect considerations for web components, Angular, and React migrations, adhering to the latest workflow and gold standard.

## Key Data to Reference
- Outputs from `analyze`, `migrate`, and `verify` steps for each file.
- The `*_framework_data.json` files (for Angular/React context).
- `component_mapping.json`, `v1_components.json`, `v2_components.json`.

## Rules
- Create a detailed log for *each file* that underwent the migration process.
- For each file log:
  - **File Identification**: Clearly state the name of the file being logged.
  - **Framework Context**: Note if the file was identified as Angular or React and if framework-specific rules were applied during analysis, migration, and verification.
  - **Analysis Summary**: Include the Markdown table from the `.analysis.md` report. Explicitly mention if the Parent-Child Migration Rule impacted any components.
  - **Migration Actions Summary**:
    - Detail which components were migrated, referencing their v1 and v2 tags.
    - List any attributes that were changed or mapped.
    - Specify components that were *not* migrated due to:
      - No v2 equivalent.
      - Being blocked by the Parent-Child Migration Rule (clearly state the parent component causing the block).
    - Note any comments added to the code regarding missing features, properties, or reasons for not migrating.
    - If framework-specific wrappers or patterns were applied (e.g., for Angular/React), describe these changes.
    - Mention if imports (web components, framework-specific, CSS) were added or modified.
  - **Verification Results**: Include the full verification summary table, list of issues, compliant points, and the overall pass/fail status as generated by the `verify` step.
  - **Overall File Status**: Based on the verification, give a clear final status for the file (e.g., "Migration Successful with Warnings", "Migration Failed", "Migration Successful").
  - **Actionable Recommendations**: List specific, actionable steps needed to address any verification failures or warnings for this file. If the Parent-Child rule blocked migrations, recommend manual review for the affected sections.
- Use Markdown headings, bullet points, and tables for clarity and readability.

## Output Format
- The primary output is a consolidated migration log, typically a single Markdown file (e.g., `migration_log.md`) that contains summaries for *all* processed files.
- Each file's summary within this log should follow the structure outlined above.

## Example (for a single file within the consolidated log)

```markdown
## File: src/app/components/my-angular-component.ts

**Framework Context**: Angular component, framework-specific rules applied.

### Analysis Summary
(Content from `my-angular-component.ts.analysis.md`)

| v1 Tag         | v2 Tag                     | Count | Notes                                         |
|----------------|----------------------------|-------|-----------------------------------------------|
| modus-parent   | N/A                        | 1     | No v2 equivalent. Parent-Child Rule applies.  |
| modus-child    | N/A (Blocked by Parent)    | 2     | Parent 'modus-parent' cannot be migrated.     |
| modus-button   | modus-wc-button            | 1     | Direct replacement. Requires Angular wrapper. |

**Notes from Analysis:**
- Consult `v1_angular_framework_data.json` and `v2_angular_framework_data.json` for `modus-button` wrapper and event handling.

### Migration Actions Summary
- **modus-parent**: Not migrated (No v2 equivalent).
  - Comment added: "// MODUS MIGRATION: 'modus-parent' not migrated (no v2 equivalent). Child components also not migrated."
- **modus-child**: Not migrated (Blocked by parent 'modus-parent').
- **modus-button**: Migrated to `modus-wc-button`.
  - Wrapped with a custom Angular component `app-modus-button` as per `v2_angular_framework_data.json` guidance.
  - Attribute `(buttonClick)` updated to `(onButtonClick)` event emitter in the wrapper.
- Imports for `@trimble-oss/moduswebcomponents-angular` and component-specific CSS added.

### Verification Results
(Content from `verify` step output for `my-angular-component.ts`)

| Section                             | Status   | Notes                                                               |
|-------------------------------------|----------|---------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Gold Standard: Imports              | Pass     | Correct Angular-specific Modus imports present.                     |
| Parent-Child Rule Adherence         | Pass     | `modus-parent` and `modus-child` correctly left unmigrated.         |
| Framework: Angular Best Practices   | Pass     | `modus-button` correctly wrapped and event handling updated.        |
| ... (other verification checks)     | ...      | ...                                                                 |

**Issues:**
- None.

**Compliant:**
- All applicable rules met.

**Overall Verification Status:** Pass

### Overall File Status & Recommendations
- **Status**: Migration Successful.
- **Recommendations**: None. Consider reviewing the unmigrated `modus-parent` section for potential manual refactoring if functionality is critical.
