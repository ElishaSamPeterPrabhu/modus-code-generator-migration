# Property Mappings

This directory is reserved for future property-level mappings between MUI and Modus components.

Currently, we use the simplified component name mappings in the parent directory:
- `mui_to_modus_mapping.json` - Maps MUI components to Modus equivalents
- `modus_to_mui_mapping.json` - Reverse mapping for reference

Property mappings will be extracted automatically from MUI source code using the extraction scripts in `component_extraction/`.
